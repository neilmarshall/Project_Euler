// If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs 
// and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that
// the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
//
// The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking 
// two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and
// thirty-five red discs.
//
// By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000
// discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.

"""
There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
such that the expression n^3 + n^2 * p is a perfect cube.

For example, when p = 19, 8^3 + 8^2 Ã— 19 = 12^3.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the
value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

Solution: 173
